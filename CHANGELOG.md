# December 16 2023 

- Fixed a bug created by the last update
- Scrapped the limited makeshift logging thing from last update and used Python's logging module for proper error handling and logging
- Fixed some typos

# November 21 2023

- Fixed some bugs that occured when the main bot was reconnecting
- Unexpected disconnection error as well as quit messages will only be sent in the channels the Discord user has joined and not all the channels the main bot is on
- Added an exception handler to catch and log errors to stop major crashes and disconnects from happening. (too many IRC clients connecting/disonnecting at once is annoying and troublesome)

# October 8th 2023
- Added system that edits the last message instead of sending a new one (if it was sent by the main bot, i.e join/part/quit/kick messages)
- Added NICKSERV identification - You will have to run setupwizard.py after pulling the updates and by choosing to edit the config you can set all the NICKSERV related info!
- Fixed a bug where on start up, if a Discord user talked before all the IRC clients were connected the process stopped and hanged without doing nothing.

# September 24th 2023
- If by any chance you were using the Bridge before this update you'll have to delete savedclients.pkl
  - As a result all the saved client info will be deleted and users will have to rejoin IRC
  - I would make it patch the file by adding all the channels to all the users' saved info but-
  - That would again lead to IRC clients joining corresponding IRC channels that they may not need to be in or don't have access to the matching Discord channels
  - Read more below:
-  Changes in commands and 1 new command: !leavechan
  -  !joinirc and !fjoinirc will join only the corresponding IRC channel, and not all channels in the channelsets
    - new argument --all 
    - if used joins all the channels the user has saved (not all the channels)
    - Before this change, when a user used !joinirc or !fjoinirc the client that was made joined all the channels in the channelsets.
    - That lead to clients joining corresponding IRC channels of Discord channels they may not chat in or didn't even have access to.
  - !leaveirc is now !quitirc (!leaveirc still works) The functionality is the same.
  - New command: !leavechan (Leaves (/part) the corresponding IRC channel.
- Fixed a bug where some characters in the end of a splitted message weren't sent (i hadn't factored the CRLF in.
- Fixed a few other minor bugs (part reasons were not relayed to Discord and other bugs/typos)
- Removed forgotten prints that flooded the terminal buffer 

# September 11th 2023
- Made the Discord bot's status change every 15 minutes to alternate versions

# August 30th 2023
- Added a command cooldown system 
  - When a Discord user uses a command, a 10 second cooldown is enabled for them for this command
  - If a Discord user has an active cooldown for 3 commands a global cooldown is enabled for them
  - The global cooldown last 60 seconds and the user cannot use any commands.
  - When a user is in any cooldown and uses a/the command again a clock emoji reaction is added to their message
- Added a new module, thetimers.py, this is an easier way for me to add delays to stuff, tsking advantage of the infinite while loop of the bot. (Feel free to use this module for your project)
- I noticed a JSONDecodeError being raised when the DiscordWebhook module attempts to relay an IRC message through Discord.
  - It happened on the bot i'm running twice in 2 consecutive days, so i've added an exception to stop the process from crashing.
  - When the module fails, the message will (hopefully) be relayed as simple text. i.e `<john> hi there`
  - (hopefully because i wasn't able to recreate the error, will update if it happens again and doesn't work)

# August 18th 2023
- Leaving the "Relay" term behind since this acts a lot more like a "Bridge" between IRC and Discord. Not just relaying in text e.g `<john> hi there`
- Added multi-channel support
  - You can now have the Bridge work in multiple combinations of IRC and Discord Channels
  - In case you were using the bot before this update, your discord channel, irc channel and webhook values will bw converted to the new format and the bot will work as before
  - To edit/add/delete channel sets use the setupwizard.py
- Changed !relayhelp to !bridgehelp
- Changed !shutdown to !bridgeshutdown and added a reason argument
- Changed !relayuptime to !bridgeuptime
- Fixed some slight color bugs in setupwizard.py

# July 26th 2023
- hotfix for a lil bug
- fixed italics not being shown on IRC messages

# July 25th 2023

- Added the relaying of message edits to IRC. 
  - When a Discord user that has an IRC client edits one of their Discord messages it will be shown on IRC as: ```EDIT: their post-edit message will be here```
- Improved the AWAY feature to check a User's status when their IRC client connects (instead of relying only on the time the user actually changes their status
  - Previously a user that was not online when the Bridge started up or when the Discord user created their IRC client, their AWAY message wouldn't be set on IRC as the bot only listened for status *changes*. Now when a client connects to IRC the Discord user's status is checked and set accordingly as their AWAY message. 
- Improved the connection of the saved clients when the bot starts
  - The dictionary containing the nessecary info will be made before the main bot connects to IRC.
  - That fixes a bug where double clients where created when a Discord user was sending messages during the bot was starting. 
  - The clients and connection objects are made as the bot connects to Discord, that way the bot doesn't try to make new objects, since there is already one for every Discord User with saved client.
  - Once the main bot is done connecting to IRC it loops through the objects and uses connect() on all of them.

# July 20th 2023

- When a Discord user changes their status from online to Idle, Dnd or offline, it will be set as their away message on IRC
  - When they go back online their away will be cleared
- Changed the alternative nicknames to be ```nickhere_[R]``` instead of ```nickhere[R]_```
- When the bot connects the saved IRC clients (during start up) it will no longer connect the IRC clients of users that are not in the Discord server. (removed/left/any reason)
- Fixed a bug in replacing IRC italics with Discord italics style.
- README updates, removed updates from README, added link to the Wiki, added Credits, raised minimum required Python version to 3.9 to support discord.py 2.0+ feats.

# July 9th 2023
- Fixed crashing bug (hopefully) The msg_split function was causing an infinite loop which eventually kills the bot

# June 29th 2023
- Bugs fixed
- Added a function that splits long messages into appropriate pieces. (IRC has a limit of 512 characters per line sent to the server.)
- When a Discord user replies to a Discord message, if the sender of the original message is a Discord user has an IRC client through the relay, their client's nick will be shown (their Discord username was shown previously.) This is done for clarity of the IRC users, as they only see the IRC nicks and not the Discord usernames.

# June 22nd 2023
- Some commands have been renamed for clarity:
  - !myircnick - New name: !whoami (same functionality)
  - !ircnick   - New name: !nick   (same functionality)
  - !usernick  - New name: !whois  (same functionality)
  - !fircnick  - New name: !fnick  (same functionality)
- New command - ```!leaveirc [--delete] [reason]``` Disconnects the user's client. (both parameters are opt
ional)
  - If --delete is used the saved client will be deleted and will not be rejoined when the bot restarts.
  - If AUTOCLIENTS is True and a user has left IRC, a client will not be made for them unless they use !joi
nirc
- !joinirc updated to use the user's saved nick (if a nick is not provided)
  - If the user doesn't have a saved nick, their username will be used (as it used to be)
  - If a nick is provided it will be saved.
  - Added an optional parameter --nick - If used, and the user has a local nick, it will be used on IRC
- --nick does the same in !fjoinirc
- Kill has been updated to accept a --delete parameter. If used it will delete the user's saved client.
- New command - ```!relayhelp <listcommands|command>``` Shows a list of available commamds or verbose info
for a command

# June 19th 2023
- Added 4 new commands
  - !fjoinirc - Makes a client for another user, used only by users in the botop list
  - !fircnick - Forcefully changes a user's nick, used only by users in the botop list, for moderation use
  - !usernick - Shows another user's nick, or their saved nick, only used by users in botop list
  - !myircnick - Shows the user's IRC nick, or their saved one, if there is one, when they don't have a connected client.
- Found and fixed a couple bugs

# June 14th 2023
- Added a setup wizard that makes or edits a config
- The clients that are made will be saved and reconnected when the bot is restarted
- The settings are now saved in a .pkl file and are not edited by hand
- Added 2 distinct modes of client creation. a) use of !joinirc command or b) automated client creation when a user sends a message.
- Added a time limit to disconnect clients for inactivity (no messages sent for X amount of time)
